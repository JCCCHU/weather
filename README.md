# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

July 7, 2020

This homework was not especially complicated, but running out of time near the end of the semester I had to cut my losses.

Here I demonstrate the API functionality through bootstrap. With a bit of digging I was able to find a predesigned dashboard off of the Bootstrap examples that I was able to modify somewhat to align with the assignment's needs.

After reading a bit about how the weather and UV APIs worked, I was able to cobble together the primary functionality of the app fairly quickly.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to get a search icon working for the search bar, or generate the recent results in the sidebar. No doubt I'll have some regrets about not experimenting with it here while I had the opportunity.
